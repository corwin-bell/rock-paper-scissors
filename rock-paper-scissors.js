/* bugs to debug
bug 1: playerSelection is undefined after entering it correctly after entering it incorrectly
    this is still true after removing recursion from playRound tie condition
    could be due to recursion in getPlayerChoice, but not clear why
solution 1: seems that including return before the recursive function call fixes this
